## You can now use LaTex to write equations :

In the frontmatter of the article add this :

`usemathjax: true`

After that, simply wrap the math symbols of your article with two double-dollar sign $$:

For Example :

- use this `$$E=mc^2$$`

You should be able to see it in your post as: $$E=mc^2$$

 use `$$mean = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$` to write :

$$mean = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$

- Use `k_{n+1} = n^2 + k_n^2 - k_{n-1}` to write

$$k_{n+1} = n^2 + k_n^2 - k_{n-1}$$
